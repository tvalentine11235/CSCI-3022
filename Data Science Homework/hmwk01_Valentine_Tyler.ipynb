You are called upon to perform an experiment to order to determine how fit CU Boulder students are for hedgehog-handling.

The file `fcq_data_info.xlsx` contains some **metadata**, which describes what all of the columns in the main data file are, and how to interpret some of the measurements.

Create side-by-side box-and-whisker plots to compare the average grades of lower-division computer science courses versus upper-division computer science courses.  Use the box-and-whisker plot conventions discussed in lecture, and be sure to include a legend and label your axes.\n",

    "**Part E:** One more hypothesis we might want to explore is whether or not there has actually been a large increase in Computer Science enrollments in recent years. There are 12 academic years of data, which means there are 24 distinct semesters (from Fall 2006 to Spring 2018). For each semester, compute the total number of students enrolled in Computer Science courses. Note that you will almost certainly be counting some students twice (or more!), but that's okay - this is still a good measure of the total demand for Computer Science classes. Use the total number of students enrolled at the end of the term as the number of students for each class.\n",

    "Make a plot of the total number of Computer Science students versus the semester, with the most recent semester (Spring 2018) on the right and most distant past (Fall 2006) on the left. Label your axes. For the semester axis (the x-axis), label with the actual semester as a character string, like \"Fall 2006\" or \"Spring 2007\", for example. You may want to look up how to rotate the x-tick labels in order to make the semester name labels fit nicely. Comment on the results and any interesting trends or patterns you notice in Computer Science enrollment numbers."
